# Humaine Studio

Organizations struggle with AI tools that create more friction than they remove. Humaine Studio builds human-AI collaboration patterns that surface evidence for better decisions.

**Current Projects:**

- **[Caldris.io](https://Caldris.io)** - Continuous compliance monitoring with transparent audit trails for ISO/SOC2
- **[Mondrian.dev](https://Mondrian.dev)** - Open source Zero Trust OS addressing the security poverty line
- **This website** - Built using Claude Code to demonstrate development acceleration principles

## Evidence-Based Approach

This site demonstrates our core principle: AI tools should show their work. Built with Jekyll and Claude Code, we documented the development process to show:

- Where AI speeds up work vs. where humans need control
- How transparent workflows reduce organizational friction
- Which collaboration patterns transfer across domains

## Technical Setup

**Features:**

- Minimal design focused on content over decoration
- Jekyll blogging with GitHub Pages deployment
- Mobile responsive with SEO optimization
- LLM.txt for AI tool compatibility

**Quick Start:**

```bash
git clone [repo-url]
gem install jekyll bundler
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

**Deployment:**
Push to main branch for automatic GitHub Pages deployment. Add custom domain via CNAME file.

**Structure:**

```
├── _config.yml     # Site configuration
├── _posts/         # Blog posts (YYYY-MM-DD-title.md)
├── _layouts/       # Page templates  
├── assets/         # CSS/JS files
└── llm.txt         # AI optimization
```
