# PostHog Cover Letter

üëãüèª | [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/c-mcconnell) | [GitHub](https://github.com/miqcie) | [Website](https://humaine.studio) | [Resume](https://humaine.studio/#resume)

## Executive Summary

**tl;dr** I'm a product obsessive that finds great pleasure in finding things out[^1] and enthusiastically sharing that knowledge[^2]. My car license plate says "scrapi"[^3]. My sales approach is a gardener teaching other to garden: nurturing relationships over time, not passively fishing or hunting for quick kills.

## Recent PostHog Contribution

I created this [pull request](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.com/pull/12507) on GitHub. @joethreepwood said, "This looks great!" @rafaeelaudibert and @Zaltsman reacted with ‚ù§Ô∏è.

The PR added a dynamic URL to the LinkedIn button on the [/academy](https://posthog.com/academy) page. It now pre-fills the certification form to post on LinkedIn. By doing this, user satisfaction ascends and shareholder value increases!

I told the world about my [Post-it note Certification](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/c-mcconnell_im-happy-to-share-that-ive-obtained-a-new-activity-7363888091675172866-FJz-?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAACf_CsBHuYPBAgR4PFaZDEYpK7-GU8vYPE) to boost my chance of getting hired by 20%.

## Why PostHog

A few other tidbits about me and my interest in working at PostHog as a TAE/TAM:
- I want to join PostHog because I can help it grow and want to be in a more technical role. Technical AND Sales. [por que no los dos?](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/why-not-both-why-dont-we-have-both) 
- Salary expectations are aligned. While I'm in interviewing with others, this is my uber duper first preference.
- I've managed sales teams from $4M-11M revenue. Increasing their income was my greatest accomplishment.
- Leadership is learned in the hot seat. I developed a [stakeholder simulation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ipFMuWeR03wRYK1FQfdiBMNfjQGdEBdpN1Upo1acJJQ/edit?usp=sharing) for NYU Stern's MBA program that mirrors the cross-functional dynamics a PostHog TAE/AM will navigate with their customers.
- Prior workplaces said I stood out for the wrong reasons[^4]. It's draining. PostHog feels like a place where I can finally stand tall without the mask.
- It's freeing to know that most people are trying to figure it out too.
- My personal site, humaine.studio is built with Jekyll, GitHub Pages, Markdown, HTML/CSS/JS so I could better learn Git. PostHog web analytics is installed.
- `gilfoyle-tech-reviewer` is the Claude agent I created to practice #vibecoding. [GitHub](https://github.com/miqcie/gilfoyle-tech-reviewer). 
- [I built this...sorta](https://humaine.studio/weeks-of-life/). In response, Gilfoyle said I'm a "[dilettante with systems instincts](https://humaine.studio/posts/2025/08/18/gilfoyle/)".
