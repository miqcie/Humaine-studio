## Overview

I believe in transparency. This page explains what data is collected when you visit humaine.studio and why.

## What I Collect

**PostHog Privacy Policy:** [posthog.com/privacy](https://posthog.com/privacy)

### Visitor Intelligence (Apollo.io)

I use [Apollo.io](https://www.apollo.io) to understand which companies and organizations visit this site. As someone actively job hunting, this helps me identify potential opportunities and interested employers.

**Apollo.io collects:**
- Your IP address and company information

## What I Don't Collect

- ❌ Personally identifiable information (names, emails) unless you contact me directly
- ❌ Credit card or payment information
- ❌ Passwords or authentication credentials
- ❌ Social security numbers or government IDs
- ❌ Health or financial data

## Cookies

This site uses cookies for analytics purposes only:

- **PostHog cookies:** Track your session and usage patterns
- **Apollo.io cookies:** Identify return visitors and company information

These are "analytics cookies" under GDPR. No advertising or tracking cookies are used.

## Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have rights under GDPR (EU), CCPA (California), or other privacy laws:

### Right to Access
Request a copy of what data has been collected about you.

### Right to Deletion
Request deletion of your data from analytics platforms.

### Right to Opt-Out
You can opt out of tracking:

**Opt out of PostHog:**

**Universal opt-out:**
Most modern browsers support "Do Not Track" requests, which I respect.

### Contact for Privacy Requests

Email me at: **{{ site.author.email }}**

I'll respond to privacy requests within 30 days.

## Data Storage & Security

- **PostHog data:** Stored on PostHog's servers (cloud-hosted in US/EU)
- **Apollo.io data:** Stored on Apollo.io's servers
- **This website:** Hosted on GitHub Pages (static files only)

This is a static website with no database. I don't have access to raw visitor data beyond what the analytics platforms provide in their dashboards.

## Changes to This Policy

I may update this privacy policy as analytics tools change. Updates will be posted here with a new "Last updated" date.

## Third-Party Services

This site uses:

| Service | Purpose | Privacy Policy |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| GitHub Pages | Website hosting | [github.com/site/privacy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement) |
| PostHog | Product analytics | [posthog.com/privacy](https://posthog.com/privacy) |
| Apollo.io | Visitor intelligence | [apollo.io/privacy](https://www.apollo.io/privacy) |
| Google Fonts | Typography | [policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) |

## Why This Transparency Matters

I write about AI, human-machine collaboration, and evidence-based approaches to technology. Transparency in data collection aligns with those values.

If you're a recruiter or hiring manager using Apollo.io yourself, you'll appreciate that I'm upfront about using the same tools.
