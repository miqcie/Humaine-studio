# 💡 Applied AI Writing & Research Task Ideas

A list of potential articles and research notes, categorized by theme, to be developed using Claude Code for acceleration and documentation.

## 1. The Human-AI Workflow and Trust (Trustworthy & Transparent Systems)

| Priority | Task ID | Topic Title | Focus | Status |
| :---: | :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| High | WFA-001 | **The Model Context Protocol (MCP) as the "Universal Remote" for AI** | Analyze the technical and user experience benefits of MCP. How does standardizing context solve problems like data silos and model hallucination in enterprise settings? | To Do |
| High | WFA-002 | **Augmentation vs. Automation: A Dignity-First Approach** | Explore the ethical and practical differences between using AI to augment a human knowledge worker versus full automation, focusing on the goal of removing tedious work. | To Do |
| Medium | WFA-003 | **The Necessity of "Showing Work": Transparency in Auditable AI** | Write about the principle of transparency in AI. Why is it crucial for human users to see the evidence, sources, and steps an AI took to reach a high-stakes conclusion? | To Do |

## 2. The Future of Work and AI Agents (Organizational & Societal Impact)

| Priority | Task ID | Topic Title | Focus | Status |
| :---: | :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| High | FWA-001 | **The Skills Gap in the Age of AI: Prompt Engineering & AI Literacy** | Analyze the new essential skills for workers, such as prompt engineering and AI literacy. How can companies invest in personalized training to help employees adapt? | To Do |
| Medium | FWA-002 | **AI Agents and Organizational Design: Managing Human-Agent Teams** | Discuss how organizational structures and leadership roles must evolve to manage teams composed of both human employees and increasingly autonomous AI agents. | To Do |
| Low | FWA-003 | **Beyond Job Replacement: The Productivity Effect and New Roles** | Argue how the massive productivity gains from AI lead to the creation of new industries and job roles, shifting human focus toward creativity and contextual understanding. | To Do |

## 3. Practical AI Implementation (Development & System Hardening)

| Priority | Task ID | Topic Title | Focus | Status |
| :---: | :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| High | PIA-001 | **From Prototype to Production: Hardening LLM Workflows** | Discuss the technical challenges of moving an AI proof-of-concept into a reliable, enterprise-grade system, covering error handling, security (Zero Trust), and auditable pipelines. | To Do |
| Medium | PIA-002 | **The Craft of AI-Assisted Development (A Case Study)** | Write about the experience of building a project (like Humaine Studio itself) using an AI coding assistant. What are the trade-offs and how does the human developer's role change? | To Do |
| Medium | PIA-003 | **Context Engineering for Reliable Agents** | Detail how structured inputs and clear context are vital for getting predictable and high-quality results from large language models, especially in complex tasks. | To Do |

## Usage Notes

### Workflow
1. **Select a topic** from this list based on priority and current interest
2. **Update status** to "In Progress" when you start writing
3. **Create research notes** in `writing-topics/notes/[TASK-ID]-notes.md`
4. **Create draft** in `_drafts/[title].md`
5. **Publish** by moving to `_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-[title].md`
6. **Update status** to "Published" when live

### Research Notes Structure
For each topic, create a notes file: `writing-topics/notes/WFA-001-notes.md`

Example structure:
```markdown
# WFA-001: MCP Research Notes

## Key Points
- [Research findings]
- [Quotes to include]
- [Examples to reference]

## Sources
- [Links]
- [Papers]
- [Projects]

## Outline Ideas
- [Potential structure]
```

### Integration with Substack
- Jekyll site (humaine.studio) = source of truth
- Substack = audience growth & email distribution
- Always set canonical URL in Substack to point to humaine.studio version
